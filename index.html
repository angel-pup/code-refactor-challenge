        img tag would be better instead of a div here, and moved image pointer to HTML from CSS for consistency.
        I think, in the future, image pointers in CSS would be just as good, if not better, but alt is still necessary in case image/CSS fails to load.
        I've also modified class to be an id here, as styling for this image is unique.

            Changed div tags to article tags. From what I'm readying, articles are better suited for sections of a webpage that contain paragraphs/comments.
            Also added ids to each article, and remove classes, as ids are more appropriate but still hold similar functionality.

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
